"""Notes tools: search, read and create (D-05).

The search does not use the Notes REST API, because it has no search route at all: the
routes are index, get, create, update, undo, autotitle, destroy, category, attachment and
settings. The server side search lives in the unified search provider ``notes``, which
matches title **and** content, sorts by modification date and answers in one request. Title
and excerpt come straight out of that answer, so a search over twenty hits stays one round
trip instead of twenty one.

    GET /ocs/v2.php/search/providers/notes/search?term=...&limit=...

Documented fallback, deliberately not built: if the Notes app is installed but the provider
is missing, ``GET /notes?exclude=content`` plus a client side title match would still find
something. That path matches titles only, so it is a degraded answer and would have to be
marked as one. The list helper it would need was written and then removed again, because an
untested branch nobody reaches is a liability, not a spare part. It is twenty lines and can
come back the day an instance without the provider actually turns up.

Two details keep the ids honest. The unified search entry has no ``id`` field, so the note
id is parsed out of ``resourceUrl``, and an entry whose URL does not end in a numeric note
segment is skipped rather than guessed at: a wrong id resolves to a different note, which
is worse than one missing hit (threat T-01-40). And ``resourceUrl`` is only ever parsed,
never fetched; the returned link is rebuilt from the configured base URL, so a manipulated
entry cannot point this server or its user at a foreign host (threat T-01-39).

The ``kein-ki`` guard and the sandbox (EXCL-05, SBX-02). A note id is the file id of the
note's file (25-MESSBERICHT K4), so the tagged file id set decides directly. The path comes
from ``dav.paths_of_fileids`` only when it is needed, that is when a folder is tagged (a
tagged category folder covers every note below it) or when ``NC_MCP_FILES_ROOT`` is not
``/``; the same lookup is the sandbox check, because its scope is the sandbox. The search
drops a tagged note silently and counts a note outside the sandbox in ``skipped`` like any
other unusable hit (D-27-04). ``notes_read`` answers every miss with one sentence,
:func:`_note_not_found`, and never passes the Notes app's own detail text on: that text
tells a note from any other file id, which would make the tool an oracle over file ids.
