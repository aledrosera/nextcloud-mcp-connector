"""Talk tools: one browse tool with two levels, and one write behind an administrative switch.

**One tool, two levels.** ``talk_browse(level=...)`` walks the conversations of the account
and the history of one of them. Two separate tools would cost two slots in every client that
limits them and two schemas in every ``tools/list``, for navigation the model can express in
one enum value (D-06). The answer envelope is the same on both levels (``level``, ``count``,
``results``), so the model learns one shape instead of two.

**The limits are enforced, not offered.** This app paginates the conversation list not at all
and orders it not at all, and one message may be 32.000 characters long, so the order, the
filter and the three cuts are made here: :data:`MAX_CONVERSATIONS` conversations,
:data:`MAX_LIMIT` messages per window and :data:`MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES` bytes per message. Every
cut is named in the answer, never silent, and every cut has a name of its own: ``truncated``
is the cut **window** of the answer level, which is why a ``next`` stands beside it, and
``message_truncated`` is the cut **text** of one single entry, which no cursor continues.
Before plan 12-01 both were called ``truncated``, and a model reading the entry level flag as
a page flag pages in a circle (DF-11-01, the finding IN-01 named for ``mail_browse`` first).

**Two things are explained before they can fail.** A missing or disabled Talk app stops both
tools at the capabilities check, before the first Talk request (SRV-04). And an account that
may not write into a conversation is refused here with a sentence and a next step, instead of
being walked into a 403 without a body; the check reads the conversation object and not the
account, and Talk's own permission middleware stays the authority. The pre-check is only the
better error message.

**The order of the checks in the write path is reversed against every other tool of this
server.** Everywhere else the app detection is the first line. In the send path the
administrative switch of TALK-04 is, before the app detection and before any client call,
because a switch that is read after the message went out has prevented nothing.

Deliberately absent: editing a message, removing one, clearing a history, sending one later,
summarising a conversation, pinning, reminding, attaching a file, sending one without
notifying anybody and setting the read marker. The client below has no code for any of it,
which is what makes the create-only annotation of ``talk_send`` honest rather than a promise
(threat T-09-03).

MAX_CONVERSATIONS = 50

#: Upper bound of one message text, in **bytes**. TALK-02 says "byte cap" literally, and this
#: project budgets in bytes everywhere else too (``MAX_TOOL_BYTES``, ``BUDGET_BYTES``), so the
#: cut is measured on the UTF-8 encoding and not on characters. The number 800 is a setting
#: and not a measurement (A6): it makes 50 messages roughly 40 KB in the worst case, and it

MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES = 800

#: The message types that belong in a history a model reads, as a positive list. TALK-02 asks
#: for "no system messages", and a negative list (``!= "system"``) would let the next new verb

#: with a file beside it, ``voice-message`` is one whose text is the transcript placeholder,
#: and ``private_reply`` is one somebody addressed to this account alone. Everything else
#: stays out on purpose: ``system`` and ``command`` are the app talking about itself,
#: ``comment_deleted`` and ``reaction_deleted`` are the traces of something that is gone,
#: ``reaction`` is a single emoji per line, and ``record-audio`` and ``record-video`` are call
#: recordings whose text says nothing about the conversation.

#: ``lib/private/Comments/Comment.php:216``), and the four collective types that regex can
#: answer with are ``group``, ``federated_group``, ``team`` and ``federated_team``; spreed then

#: person, which is what this tool is for.
#:
#: The quote is optional on both halves of the pattern. In the server regex the prefixed forms
#: only work quoted, because its unquoted alternative has no ``/`` in the character class, and
#: spreed skips the unquoted spelling as well (``lib/Chat/Parser/UserMention.php:138-145``).
#: Refusing it anyway is the same precaution that refuses ``@here``: a version in which the
#: other spelling works costs nothing here, and no legitimate address of one person is lost.
#:
#: Two boundaries keep real people sendable. The lookahead after the two words is what makes

    The guard is asked only when there is something to ask about: a window without a single
    parameter of type ``file`` and without a file conversation costs no request at all
    (pitfall 8). Otherwise the one scope of this tool call decides, shared with every other
    part of the call, so a whole window costs at most one REPORT.

    How a reference is decided in the ``active`` state:

    *   A parameter with a path (relative to the home of this account, as Talk sends it to
        the viewer) is checked by path and file id. Guests get ``path = name``, which is no
        home path, so a path that equals the name and holds no ``/`` counts as missing.
    *   A reference without a usable path (and every file conversation) is decided by its
        file id alone when no folder carries the tag. When one does, the ids are resolved
        into paths with one ``dav.paths_of_fileids`` call; an id that does not resolve is
        withheld (fail-closed), and a failing lookup withholds every file reference like the
        ``unverifiable`` state does.
    *   A reference with neither a path nor a numeric id is withheld.

    Talk gets no sandbox of its own for file names (the SBX requirements do not name Talk),
    only the tag. With ``NC_MCP_FILES_ROOT`` set and a tagged folder, a pathless reference
    outside the root does not resolve and therefore stays raw; noted for phase 29.

    The order of this function is the reverse of every other tool of this server, and the
    first line is what reverses it: the administrative switch of TALK-04 is read before the
    app is looked up and before any client call, because a switch that is read after the
    message went out has prevented nothing (threat T-09-20).

    Six refusals follow, and each of them is cheaper than the write it prevents.

    The length comes from the instance (``config.chat.max-length``) with the number Talk 24
    ships as the fallback, so the limit is not maintained a second time here, and it is
    counted the way the server counts it rather than approximately. The chain is three links
    and every one of them is read out of the source rather than assumed:
    ``ChatController::sendMessage`` hands the text on (spreed v24.0.4,
    ``lib/Controller/ChatController.php:416``), ``ChatManager::sendMessage`` calls
    ``$comment->setMessage($message, self::MAX_CHAT_LENGTH)`` with ``MAX_CHAT_LENGTH = 32000``
    (``lib/Chat/ChatManager.php:407``, constant at ``:72``), and the check itself is two lines
    of Nextcloud core: ``$message = trim($message);`` followed by
    ``if ($maxLength && mb_strlen($message, 'UTF-8') > $maxLength)`` (nextcloud/server
    v34.0.0, ``lib/private/Comments/Comment.php:186-189``).

    So the unit is characters and not bytes, and ``mb_strlen`` on UTF-8 counts code points
    exactly as Python's ``len`` does; an umlaut is one for both of them. The one thing this
    pre-check used to get wrong is the ``trim`` in the line above the comparison: a text at the
    limit with a trailing newline was refused here although Nextcloud would have taken it, so
    :data:`_PHP_TRIM` is stripped first, with PHP's character list and not Python's wider one.
    A message that is too long anyway gets Talk's own answer as the backstop, which is a 413
    from that controller (``:448``) and reaches the caller with the app's own message.

    A collective mention is refused, and not only the two that mean everybody. ``@all`` is the
    one that works everywhere: Talk turns it into a notification of every participant of the
    conversation, which makes one tool call a message to everybody. ``@"group/<id>"``,
    ``@"team/<id>"`` and their two federated spellings are the same amplifier one size smaller,
    one notification per member of a whole group or team, so they are refused with it (threat
    T-09-23; the six spellings and their source in spreed 24 and in the Nextcloud comment
    parser stand at :data:`_MENTION_COLLECTIVE`). ``@here`` is ordinary text in spreed 24 and is
    refused as a precaution against a version in which it is not. The two boundaries of that
    pattern matter, because a plain containment test would refuse ``@allan``, ``@allison`` and
    ``@grouping`` as well, and those are legitimate mentions of real people; so is
    ``@"federated_user/alice@cloud.example"``, which addresses exactly one person and passes.

    A missing token is refused before that lookup, the same way :func:`browse` refuses one, so
    the cheapest mistake a caller can make costs no request at all. It also closes a second
    door: an empty string is what a conversation without a token of its own would match in the
    list, and matching it there is worse than not asking.

    The token has to stand in the conversation list of this account, so the pre-check goes
    through ``talk_client.get_rooms`` (in :func:`one_room`) and never through the single
    conversation route: an unknown token there is a counted brute force attempt against the
    address of this whole container, which is one address for every user of the instance.

    Then the conversation object decides whether this account may write into it at all, by the
    three rules of :func:`_may_send`.

    There is no retry. If this call times out, that does not mean nothing was posted, and a
    second attempt would place a message twice in somebody else's chat, where no tool of this
    server can remove it again. The answer carries the id and the name of the conversation so
    the model can read back instead of repeating (threat T-09-25).
